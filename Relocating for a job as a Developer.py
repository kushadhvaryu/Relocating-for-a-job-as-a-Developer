# # 5 Things to keep in mind before relocating for a job as a Developer

# ## Business Understanding
# 
# For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:
# 
# - As a budding developer, should you relocate for a job in the West (e.g. America, Europe, etc.)?
# - Are developers really paid more in the West than they are in the East?
# - Are the developers really satisfied with their jobs and career in the West?
# - Should the developers need to develop new skills to get a job in either the West or the East?

# ## Data Understanding
# 
# First, I provided a general view to the data. I found out things like what level of developer they were and which country did they belong to. Also, I had a quick look on their employment status and how they thought about their paycheck.

# ## Conclusion
# 
# - I compared the salary based on how many years of coding experience a developer has had between the East and the West. I found that the salary of a developer in the East is much lower than that of the West no matter how many years of coding experince they have had.
# - I also looked at the difference in opinion about feeling underpaid between developer both in the West and the East. This showed that more developers in the East thought that they were underpaid than the West irrespective of years of coding experience they have accumulated.
# - I found that the Career and Job Satisfaction of the developers in the West are much higher than those in the East.
# - Finally, I found that there is no language preference for programming between the East and the West so it should not prove to be a hindrance for getting a job while you are relocating from either zones.
