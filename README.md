## Installations <a name = "installations"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

If these libraries are not already installed on your device you can install them easily

You will need to download Stackoverflowâ€™s 2017 Annual Developer Survey and put in specific folders. You can find the data to download [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). </br>

## Project Motivation <a name = "projectmotivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

- As a budding developer, should you relocate for a job in the West (e.g. America, Europe, etc.)?
- Are developers really paid more in the West than they are in the East?
- Are the developers really satisfied with their jobs and career in the West?
- Should the developers need to develop new skills to get a job in either the West or the East?
