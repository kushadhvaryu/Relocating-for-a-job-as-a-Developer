## Installations

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

- As a budding developer, should you relocate for a job in the West (e.g. America, Europe, etc.)?
- Are developers really paid more in the West than they are in the East?
- Are the developers really satisfied with their jobs and career in the West?
- Should the developers need to develop new skills to get a job in either the West or the East?

## File Descriptions

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available here. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
